== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this change the file URL? =
No. Medianest uses a virtual folder system (custom taxonomy). Your file URLs (e.g., `.../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.jpg`) remain exactly the same. It is safe to install and uninstall without breaking links.

= Can I import my existing folder structure? =
Yes, Medianest allows you to import folder structures via CSV.

= Does it work with page builders? =
Medianest works with the native WordPress Media Library, so it is compatible with most page builders that use the standard media modal (Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, etc.).
